# Oware_Mancala-Game

A simple game inspired by the ancient game Mancala with the help of pygame

# Description
Oware is a two-player strategy board game that is popular in many parts of Africa and is part of the larger family of Mancala games. The game is played on a wooden board consisting of two rows of six small pits or holes, called "houses," and a larger pit on each end, called the "score pit." 


# Rules for playing the game
Players take turns sowing the seeds from one of their houses, moving in a counterclockwise direction around the board. 
If the last seed lands in a player's own house, they get to take another turn. 
If the last seed lands in an empty house on their side of the board and the opponent's house directly opposite contains seeds, the player captures all the seeds in both houses and moves them to their score pit.

# Main Objective of the game
The objective of the game is to capture as many seeds as possible from the opponent's side of the board and move them into one's own score pit. 
 The game ends when a player has captured all the seeds on their opponent's side of the board, and the player with the most seeds in their score pit at the end of the game wins.
